**CasADi Optimization Toolbox (MATLAB)**
-----
This repository contains a small CasADi-based MATLAB toolbox for solving optimization problems, mainly focusing on unconstrained and constrained minimization as well as Mean Squared Error (MSE) optimization for linear regression.
The codes are written in MATLAB and use CasADi for symbolic modeling and numerical optimization.

**MSE_optimization.m**
<br>
MATLAB code for linear regression path estimation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) minimization.
<br>
The optimization problem is formulated and solved to find the best regression parameters that minimize the MSE.
<br>

**MSE_figure.m**
<br>
MATLAB script for plotting and visualizing results.
<br>
Typically used to display regression curves, data points, and optimization results generated by MSE_optimization.m.
<br>

**casadi2variables.m**
<br>
MATLAB code to find the minimum of an unconstrained function of two variables.
<br>
Uses CasADi to symbolically define the objective function and solve the optimization problem without any variable constraints.
<br>

**casadi2variables_ver2.m**
<br>
MATLAB code to find the minimum of a two-variable function with constraints.
<br>
Variable bounds or constraints are included in the optimization formulation using CasADi.
<br>

**casadi_test.m**
<br>
MATLAB code for finding the minimum of a single-variable function.
<br>
The optimization problem is unconstrained and serves as a simple test/example for using CasADi in MATLAB.
