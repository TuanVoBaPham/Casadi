**MSE_optimization.m**
MATLAB code for linear regression path estimation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) minimization.
The optimization problem is formulated and solved to find the best regression parameters that minimize the MSE.

**MSE_figure.m**
MATLAB script for plotting and visualizing results.
Typically used to display regression curves, data points, and optimization results generated by MSE_optimization.m.

**casadi2variables.m**
MATLAB code to find the minimum of an unconstrained function of two variables.
Uses CasADi to symbolically define the objective function and solve the optimization problem without any variable constraints.

**casadi2variables_ver2.m**
MATLAB code to find the minimum of a two-variable function with constraints.
Variable bounds or constraints are included in the optimization formulation using CasADi.

**casadi_test.m**
MATLAB code for finding the minimum of a single-variable function.
The optimization problem is unconstrained and serves as a simple test/example for using CasADi in MATLAB.
